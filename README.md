 I just wanted to create a traditional craps game that has one player.
 You would start off with the come out roll. 7 or 11 is the winner on the come out roll.
 2,3,12's are crap numbers on the come out roll, which means you will lose your money.

 If you roll a 4,5,6,8,9, and 10 they will become your point number to earn more money on.
 If you roll a 7 while your point is active you will lose.
